### I am a *Web Development* student and this is a project for my course at CareerFoundry. It consists of programming a simple, yet functional, portfolio website that can navigate between web pages on both mobile and desktop versions to feature my web development work.

#### In this project I used the following technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS
